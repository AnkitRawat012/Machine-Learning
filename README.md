# Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **sentiment analysis of Twitter data** using **Machine Learning techniques**.  
The goal is to classify tweets into **Positive, Negative, or Neutral sentiments** by applying natural language processing (NLP) and supervised learning models.

The project demonstrates the **end-to-end ML workflow**:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature extraction
- Model training
- Model evaluation
- Sentiment prediction
